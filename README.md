Vendication- A Vending Machine Revolution.
    Bop it, Twist it, Vend it
    
How to use our app:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. After opening the repo on an IDE, cd into the SOFT2412-A2 folder.
3. To run, please enter 'gradle run --console=plain' into the terminal.
4. Upon opening, you'll see a list of the items in the vending machine that you can buy, organised by category.
5. Notice that there are two letters in brackets following each item name. That's each item's item code. Buy by referencing that item code.
6. Read our help guidelines. Currently the only functionality our app has are to buy with cash or card and to exit. Note that if you ever need to see this screen again then you can type 'help' into the terminal. Further, if you need to see how to run any of our functionalities, you can run 'help < command >' into the terminal, where < command > is one of the commands printed when you enter 'help' into the terminal.
7. Enjoy!
